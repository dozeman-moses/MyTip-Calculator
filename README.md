# MyTip-Calculator
A tip calculator which helps to calculate a tip and the total of all transactions made.

For example, if I went to a restaurant and I decided to buy something. But then, as a form of gift I decided to tip the waiter. I could use this web app. Click the tip percent then it shows
the percentage and also calculates the total
